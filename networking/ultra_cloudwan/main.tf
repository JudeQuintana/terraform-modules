* Idea: Ultra CloudWAN for Super Router
*
* Super Router provides scalable cross-region peering and routing between tgws and vpcs (no dx or vpn).

*
* I was was thinking about building a cloudwan module to connect several super routers togther but only go thru cloudwan if the destination region is not one of the super routerâ€™s tgw pair (ie. us-west-2 <=> eu-central-1):
