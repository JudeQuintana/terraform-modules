now that aws is charging for public IPv4 at an hourly rate (~$3.60 per month)
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-public-ipv4-address-charge-public-ip-insights/

its proabably a good idea to build IPv6 versions of:
- tiered_vpc_ng
- centralized_router
- super_router
- intra_vpc_security_group_rules
- super_intra_vpc_security_group_rules
